1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

    React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create small reusable components that interacts with the DOM. It is great and efficient for big applications when you can reuse components again. 

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

    To think in React is to think of components as building blocks. When you start a project, if you divide all of your objects into smaller blocks, you can piece those together one by one to create your project.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/       Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

    Function/Presentational components are used when you would like parts of your project to be static. There is not user interactivity with those components. 

    Class components are similar to functional components but add a layer of complexity. It gives you the ability to manipulate "state". This allows the website to change under certain conditions.

1.  Describe state.

    State is the "state" of the DOM. It is an object that represents parts of the app that can change.

1.  Describe props.

    Props is short for properties. It's how components can talk to each other. Props flow from parent to child and don't change like state can.
